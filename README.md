# Nuptake_project

## Theory
Nitrogen is a fundamental building block for plant growth, impacting yield, quality, and overall crop performance. To provide plants with this essential element, nitrogen is introduced into the soil through N-fertilizers. However, excessive nitrogen application can lead to the accumulation of this nutrient in the soil, resulting in N2O emissions or nitrate leaching. On the other hand, insufficient nitrogen input can lead to reduced crop yield, therefore it is crucial to optimize the fertilizer application rate. Knowing the nitrogen uptake of the crop can help us adjust the N-fertilizer input. Nitrogen uptake can be measured manually using destructive methods, in which the crop samples are obtained from the field and analyzed in the lab. Even though this method is very accurate, it is difficult and time-consuming. In contrast, satellite-derived vegetation indices provide quickly and easily field-scale crop information, which could potentially enable us to measure the nitrogen uptake of the crops in real time without the need for expensive instruments. 

## Goal
The main goal is to analyze the correlation between measured nitrogen uptake and vegetation indices and create a prediction model of plant nitrogen uptake.
I also tried to correlate the vegetation indices with crop height and LAI.

## Methods
The project was done in two parts:
1. Experimental part
2. Remote sensing and data analysis

### Experimental part
First, it is important to measure values related to nitrogen uptake, mainly dry biomass weight and nitrogen concentration. This is done through biomass sampling and analysis of the samples in the laboratory.
The process was as follows:

+ Biomass sampling
  - the samples were taken using a grid of size 0.1 m<sup>2</sup>
  - 3 samples were taken per quadrant
+ Weighing of the biomass before and after drying, obtaining the <b>dry biomass weight</b>
+ Processing of the biomass
  - double milling and weighing for isolab
+ Analysis of the biomass in the laboratory, obtaining the <b>nitrogen concentration</b>
