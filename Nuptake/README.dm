Nitrogen uptake is calculated using the equation:
<Nuptake (g/m<sup>2</sup>) = (dry biomass weight) x (N concentration)/100
The biomass weight and nitrogen concentration values were obtained in the experimental part of the project.

Correlation of Calculated Nitrogen Uptake and VIs
Values of each vegetation were plotted against the measured nitrogen uptake.
