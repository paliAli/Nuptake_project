# Nitrogen Uptake
Knowing the nitrogen uptake of the crop can help us adjust the N-fertilizer input.

Nitrogen uptake is calculated using the equation:
<Nuptake (g/m<sup>2</sup>) = (dry biomass weight) x (N concentration)/100
The biomass weight and nitrogen concentration values were obtained in the experimental part of the project.

# Correlation of Calculated Nitrogen Uptake and VIs
Values of each vegetation were plotted against the measured nitrogen uptake.
